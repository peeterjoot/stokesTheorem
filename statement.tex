Stokes' theorem is fairly easy to state, but takes a fair amount of work to understand and unpack its implications.

\input{../gabookI/calculus/stokesTheoremTheStatement.tex}

This dot product defines the oriented surface ``area'' elements associated with the ``volume'' element \( d^k \Bx \).  That area element can be obtained from the mnemonic

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:stokesTheoremCore:1561}
\sum_i d^k \Bx \cdot \Bx^i,
\end{dmath}

with each of the ith differentials evaluated.  This will be made clear by example.
